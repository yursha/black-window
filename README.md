# terminal-emulator

This is a fork of `st` (simple terminal) to make it even simpler.
Original project is at http://st.suckless.org/.
I was looking for a simle terminal emulator to fork for educational (and practical) purposes.
A [quick study](review.md) of existing terminal emulators revealed that `st` fits the best.
